How does aspirin work to prevent blood clots?,[]," Aspirin works by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which reduces the production of thromboxane A2, a substance that promotes platelet aggregation. By decreasing thromboxane A2 levels, aspirin reduces the ability of platelets to clump together, thereby preventing the formation of blood clots. This antiplatelet effect is particularly beneficial in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes.","Aspirin works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, which reduces the production of thromboxane A2. Thromboxane A2 promotes platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction.

A healthcare provider will ask about symptoms, triggers, and family history of asthma or allergies. They may perform a physical exam to check for signs of asthma, such as wheezing or difficulty breathing. Lung function tests, like spirometry, measure how well the lungs are working and can help confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, additional tests like allergy testing or a methacholine challenge may be conducted to further evaluate the condition.","Asthma is diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and lung function tests. Spirometry measures how much air you can exhale and how quickly. Peak flow monitoring tracks breathing patterns. Allergy testing may identify triggers.

How does vaccination work against infectious diseases?,[]," Vaccination works by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight off specific pathogens, such as viruses or bacteria. When a vaccine is administered, it introduces a harmless component of the pathogen, such as a weakened or inactivated form, or a piece of its genetic material. This prompts the immune system to produce antibodies and train immune cells to respond more effectively if exposed to the actual pathogen in the future. As a result, vaccination helps to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and protects individuals from severe illness.","Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to recognize and fight specific pathogens without causing disease. They contain weakened, inactivated, or parts of the pathogen, or genetic material that instructs cells to produce harmless pathogen components. This 'teaches' the immune system to produce antibodies and memory cells for future protection.",0.0,0.9656512725617264,0.0,0.0

What are the complications of untreated high blood pressure?,[]," Untreated high blood pressure, or hypertension, can lead to several serious complications, including:

1. Heart disease: High blood pressure can cause the arteries to harden and thicken, leading to coronary artery disease, heart failure, or other heart-related issues.

2. Stroke: Hypertension increases the risk of stroke by causing blood vessels in the brain to rupture or become blocked.

3. Kidney damage: High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to kidney disease or failure.

4. Vision loss: Hypertension can cause damage to the blood vessels in the eyes, potentially leading to vision problems or blindness.

5. Sexual dysfunction: High blood pressure can lead to erectile dysfunction in men and decreased libido in women.

6. Peripheral artery disease: Hypertension can cause narrowing of the arteries in the legs, leading to pain and mobility issues.

7. Aneurysms: High blood pressure can lead to the formation of aneurysms, which are bulges in the arteries that can rupture and cause life-threatening bleeding.

8. Cognitive impairment: Untreated hypertension may contribute to cognitive decline and increase the risk of dementia.

It is important to manage high blood pressure to prevent these complications. Regular check-ups and lifestyle changes, along with medication if necessary, can help control blood pressure levels.","Untreated high blood pressure can lead to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, kidney damage, vision loss, peripheral artery disease, aortic aneurysms, and cognitive decline.

How does chemotherapy work in cancer treatment?,[]," Chemotherapy works by using powerful drugs to kill fast-growing cancer cells in the body. These drugs can interfere with the cancer cells' ability to grow and divide, ultimately leading to cell death. Chemotherapy can also affect some normal cells that divide quickly, which is why it can cause side effects such as nausea, hair loss, and fatigue. The treatment is often given in cycles, allowing the body time to recover between doses. Different chemotherapy drugs may be used depending on the type of cancer and its stage.","Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill rapidly dividing cancer cells. Since cancer cells divide faster than normal cells, they are more susceptible. However, it can also damage healthy cells causing side effects. Different drugs target various cell division phases. Combination therapies improve effectiveness and reduce resistance.",0.0,0.9299691236296109,0.0,1.0
